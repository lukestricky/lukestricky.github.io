## Introduction

Recently, my crew Christian and I acquired a new-to-us 505, a rare build made from carbon Nomex prepreg. When we first got it, the boat was rigged fairly bare, the shroud was adjustable from one side, both the shroud and forestay lacked sufficient purchase, the ram-up control was missing entirely, and several other important systems were either incomplete or absent.

Over the winter, we spent a considerable amount of time planning improvements and upgrades. Our goal was to maximize adjustability while keeping the boat’s rigging simple and tidy. Essentially, we wanted the ideal setup: highly adjustable without the clutter of unnecessary ropes everywhere.

Throughout May, we tackled several major projects. We repainted the chipped floor, redesigned and improved the shroud, vang, and forestay controls, including a new slack management system and added adjustable jib sheet in/out haulers. Additionally, we enhanced the aft flap design to prevent leaks, implemented a ram-up control system, connected the ram-up and ram-down controls into a continuous single line, and even installed an automatic ram for simplified rake adjustments.

Overall, we’re excited about the improvements and look forward to seeing them in action.
## Repainted floor
When we first got the boat, the floor was in rough shape, desperately needing a repaint due to chipping. We decided to use Tremclad paint, as we found a color that closely matched the existing floor. To prepare the surface, we used rough sponges and sandpaper to remove any loose paint chips without sacrificing the original texture.

Next, we masked off the surrounding areas, cleaned the floor with acetone, and carefully applied multiple thin coats of paint to avoid drips and ensure a smooth finish.

Below are before, during, and after photos to show the improvement.

## Redid Grip tape

We felt the boat deserved fresh grip tape along with the other changes. We chose EVA foam since it comes with a strong adhesive backing and is commonly used on wake boat flooring, so we're confident it'll hold up to the elements. Our only concern is how well it will stay adhered around tight bends or corners. I'll provide an update on its durability after we've had a chance to sail with it for a full season.

## Shroud, Forestay, and Vang controls

The shroud, forestay, and vang controls are the most frequently adjusted lines on the boat, so we decided to make them double-sided and continuous for easier handling. To achieve this, we built a custom carbon bracket to hold three cleats, routed the slack from the control lines below deck, and incorporated turning blocks to maintain the continuous loop of each line.

The forestay system, including how slack is managed, is illustrated below. The approach we took is similar for the shroud and vang systems as well.

The bracket itself was constructed using a 3D-printed mold and a makeshift vacuum bagging setup. With five layers of carbon fiber and a robust shape, the bracket is more than strong enough to securely support the three cleats under sailing loads.

## Jib In/Out
Inspired by Thompson Boat Works, I designed our boat’s jib in/out system primarily as an "out" setup that can easily transition to an "in" system in lighter conditions. This adaptability is made possible using snatch blocks and a detachable purchase system.

To implement this, I drilled a couple of additional holes to help route the control lines, but for the most part, I leveraged existing holes and blocks from previous rigging setups. This kept modifications minimal while providing flexibility for varying sailing conditions.

## Flaps

When I first sailed the boat last year, I noticed the flaps were letting in water. I suspected this was because they only had a single attachment point in addition to the bungee to pulling at an angle rather than perpendicular to the transom. To address this, I drilled two additional holes in each flap and reconfigured the pulling system using low-friction rings from the improved windward sheeting setup. This ensured a perpendicular pull, applying even force across the flaps and effectively preventing water from leaking in.

## Auto Ram

Adding an automatic ram to the boat has always been on my to-do list because it simplifies sailing by eliminating one extra control to manage during quick rake adjustments.

My plan was to set up the ram with an 8:1 system for both up and down, controlled by a single rope that's adjustable on the centerboard trunk. Additionally, I intended to link the ram to the forestay using a 2:1 ratio.

After reviewing the ram settings, I noticed that the ram lowers approximately 1 inch for every 4 inches of mast rake, creating a natural 4:1 ratio. Considering the forestay itself has about a 1:2 relationship with the mast rake, using a 2:1 connection between the ram and the forestay effectively achieves the desired 1:4 ratio of ram movement to mast rake.
